    Yes, there is a simple, quick, affordable solution to dealing with both earwax buildup and ear itch: Clinere<sup>&reg;</sup> Ear Cleaners.
  </p>
  <p>
      Inspired by physicians’ professional ear cleaning tools, our patented soft, flexible ear cleaning tools provide a gentle, effective way to remove unwanted earwax. Use the scooped end to spoon out earwax or ear debris or the other end, with an ingenious fin, to scratch that itch safely while exfoliating the skin cells of the outer ear canal. Use Clinere<sup>&reg;</sup> Ear Cleaners every day as part of your morning or evening routine, and you’ll never need to deal with earwax buildup again.

  <h3>Ear's the problem you're trying to solve.</h3>
  <p>
      Ear boogers. Alaskan Gold Rush. Ear potatoes. Whatever you call it, earwax occurs in the outer ear canal. It can be pushed inward and compacted by sound-muffling earplugs, ear buds, hearing aids, and, most of all, cotton swabs. This problem is compounded by the urge to dig the wax out with any number of ill-advised objects, including cotton swabs. You may have even tried liquid solutions and found them messy and time-consuming. Clinere<sup>&reg;</sup> Ear Cleaners solve all these issues.
  </p>
  <h3>The feel-good solution you've been looking for.</h3>
  <p>
      With all the ear care options out there, you want to choose the safest, most effective tool available—one that isn’t messy, expensive, time consuming or potentially harmful.
