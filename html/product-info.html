  <h3>Ear's the problem you're trying to solve.</h3>
  <p>
      Ear boogers. Alaskan Gold Rush. Ear potatoes. Whatever you call it, earwax occurs in the outer ear canal. It can be pushed inward and compacted by sound-muffling earplugs, ear buds, hearing aids, and, most of all, cotton swabs. This problem is compounded by the urge to dig the wax out with any number of ill-advised objects, including cotton swabs. You may have even tried liquid solutions and found them messy and time-consuming. Clinere<sup>&reg;</sup> Ear Cleaners solve all these issues.
  </p>
  <h3>The feel-good solution you've been looking for.</h3>
  <p>
      With all the ear care options out there, you want to choose the safest, most effective tool available—one that isn’t messy, expensive, time consuming or potentially harmful. Scooping earwax out with Clinere<sup>&reg;</sup> Ear Cleaners feels good because you can be sure that it’s safe (when used as directed), easy, quick and effective. You can also take care of any annoying ear itch with the exfoliating fin.

      For an added feeling of comfort, dip Clinere<sup>&reg;</sup> Ear Cleaners in warm water before use.
