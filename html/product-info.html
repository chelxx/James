  <h3>Ear's the problem you're trying to solve.</h3>
  <p>
    Ear boogers. Alaskan gold rush. Ear potatoes. Whatever you call it, earwax occurs in the outer ear canal.
    It can be pushed inward and compacted by sound-muffling ear plugs, ear buds, hearing aids, and most of all, cotton swabs.
    As you are well aware, this problem is compounded by the urge to dig the wax out with any number of ill-advised objects.
    You may have tried liquid solutions and found them messy and time-consuming.
    <strong>Clinere<sup>&reg;</sup> Ear Cleaners</strong> solves all these problems.
  </p>

    the <strong>Clinere<sup>&reg;</sup> Ear Cleaner</strong> feels good because you can be sure it's safe
