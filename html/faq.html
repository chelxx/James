                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg twentypt-lg under">What is Earwax?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Earwax is an accumulation of many different skin oils, skin debris, dirt, and other exudates that collects in
                    the ear canal. It protects the skin of the ear canal, helps keep your ear clean and lubricate, and helps
                    protect against bacteria, fungi, insects, and water. Earwax is made up of shed skin cells hair, and the secretions
                    of the ceruminous and sebaceous glands of the outside ear canal. Chemically, earwax is made up of a long
                    chain of fatty acids (both saturated and unsaturated), alcohols, squalene, and cholesterol. While earwax
                    helps protect your ears, too much build up or compacted cerumen can press against the eardrum or black the
                    outside ear canal or hearing aids. This can lead to hearing loss.</p>

                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">How Do I Know If I Have Too Much Earwax?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">If you want to know if you have too much earwax you can see a doctor or medical professional. Without a doctor’s
                    visit, you can spot potential earwax problems if you are suffering from hearing loss, ear pain, pressure,
                    itching, plugging, dizziness, drainage from your ears, ringing in your ears, or other uncomfortable sensations.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">What causes excessive earwax production?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Some people are genetically prone to produce too much earwax. However, having excessive wax doesn’t automatically
                    lead to a blockage. The most common cause of earwax blockage is at-home removal from people using cotton
                    swabs, bobby pins, or other objects that push wax deep into the ear, causing the blockage to occur.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">Is Earwax Good or Bad?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">There is nothing inherently bad about earwax. Your body produces it naturally to lubricate and clean your ears.
                    Your skin produces oils to lubricate and protect against drying that can come from water loss and heat damage.
                    Your ears produce earwax to moisturize the ear canal and protect the ears from dirt, debris, bacteria, and
                    other pathogens. You need a moderate coating of earwax for it to protect your ears properly. If you have
                    too much wax, however, you can end up with dirty and poorly functional ears. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">Why Do I Have a Problem with Earwax?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Everyone’s body produces earwax differently, and earwax production is largely attributed to your genetics. Since
                    you have more than one ear, it’s entirely possible for one ear to have too much earwax or a blockage while
                    the other ear is perfectly fine. Some people also have more narrow or contoured ear canals than others, which
                    can lead to problems with earwax that other people do not experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">What are the symptoms of earwax impaction?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">If you have impacted earwax, you may feel a fullness or pain in your ear. You may also experience increasing
                    difficulty hearing. Ringing in your ear (also known as tinnitus) or itchiness inside the ear are also common.
                    Some people may experience a discharge or odor coming from the ear. Additionally, too much earwax can cause
                    some people to feel dizziness.</p>

                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">What is the most common type of earwax? </h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">People produce earwax differently, and that is largely attributed to genetics and is expressed differently in
                    different races. Some people produce wet earwax, while others produce a dryer variation. The white, flaky
                    type likely means that your sweat may lack a certain chemical. </p>

                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">Are Wax Softeners or Irrigation Products Good at Removing Earwax?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">These can be helpful, but earwax still needs to be removed after the use of wax softeners. Moreover, blind irrigation
                    may also potentially flush ear wax deeper into the ear canal by moistening earwax and encourage infection.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">Are Ear Candles Good at Removing Earwax?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Numerous studies have shown that ear candling, does nothing to help your ears. In some cases, ear candling can
                    cause serious injuries to your inner ear.</p>

                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Although hydrogen peroxide is the primary component in many eardrop solutions, research has shown that it may
                    not be critical to treating earwax buildup. </p>

                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Look for Clinere cleaners and Clinere Earwax removal kits online or at your favorite local retailer and follow
                    the instructions for the product. If needed you should see a doctor.</p>

                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">What causes earwax buildup in adults?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Some people are naturally prone to producing too much earwax. In most cases, this is based entirely on genetics.
                    The most common cause of earwax blockages is at-home removal. Using cotton swabs, bobby pins, or other objects
                    can push the wax deeper, causing a blockage.</p>

                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">Do earbud headphones cause earwax buildup?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Extensive ear plug and earbud wearing can prevent your earwax from falling out naturally. These ear devices act
                    as a stopper in the conveyor belt process that your ears naturally use to clean themselves. These objects
                    can push your naturally occurring wax deeper into your ear canal, which can lead to a wax buildup. This can
                    lead to blockages, also known as earwax compaction.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">How do you clean earbud headphones?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Gently dry brush the wax out of the earbud with a nylon bristle toothbrush. Hold them with the mesh facing down
                    so gravity can take care of falling debris. If you see a waxy buildup, dip Clinere® in rubbing alcohol, tap
                    it off, and scoop the bud to remove anything remaining. When done, wipe the earbud and surrounding area with
                    an alcohol wipe to mildly clean and disinfect the earbud. Do not use soapy water, cleaning products, or perfume
                    as they can seep into the ear bud and cause damage.</p>

            <div class="faq">
                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">Do hearing aids cause earwax buildup?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Hearing aid users have a higher risk of having impacted earwax. In fact, hearing aids may stimulate glands in
                    the ear canal to produce more wax than normal. Roughly 60-70% of hearing aids sent in for repair are damaged
                    by earwax. Clinere® is incredibly popular with people who wear hearing aids because it makes it easier to
                    clean ears and the hearing aids themselves.</p>

                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">How do you stop itchy ears caused by your hearing aid?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Itching is most common for people when hearing aids are new. It can also be caused by too aggressively cleaning
                    earwax from your ears. Using a cotton swab to clean your ears can scrape away keratin, the protective material
                    that lines your ear canal. Removing keratin exposes a more sensitive layer of skin underneath, which is prime
                    for irritation and itching. On the flip side, excessive ear wax or moisture can cause irritation or itching.
                    Avoid exposing your ear canals to water, and make sure to clean your ears safely with Clinere® Ear Cleaners.</p>

                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">No, you should not use cotton swabs Q tips to clean out your ears. The packaging typically says ‘Do not insert
                    swab into ear canal. Cotton swabs are not designed to remove earwax. Instead, they push wax deeper into the

                <h1 class="firasans-semi blue-text twentypt-lg under">Why does the inside of my ear itch all the time?</h1>
                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Itchy ears can be caused by an excessive buildup of earwax, allergies, or multiple other conditions. The most
                    common causes of itching are nervous habits, fungal infections, or the beginning of an infection. Ear itch
                    can also be caused by psoriasis or dermatitis. The patented fin end of Clinere® is designed specifically
                    to safely relieve itching and exfoliate your ear. If the problem persists, see a doctor.</p>

                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Yes, you can use vegetable oil to clean out your ears but, along with mineral oil, may cause allergic reactions.
                    Do NOT put any liquid in your ear if you have a perforated eardrum. Don’t use hydrogen peroxide or any other

                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">Yes, coconut oil is safe to use if it is the right temperature. Warm it in the microwave for a few seconds until
                    it becomes a liquid, then test it with your finger to make sure it is warm but not hot. Place a half to one
                    tablespoon maximum of the oil in your ear and allow it to sit for 10 minutes before draining naturally.</p>

                <p class="firasans-reg twentypt-lg">If you want to remove excess earwax at home, the following methods are the safest way to get the job done: Wipe
                    the area with a warm, damp washcloth to soften the skin. Do not use a cotton swab to remove earwax. This
                    will only push the earwax further into your ear canal. Once the area is softened, gently use Clinere® to
                    scoop out extra wax and the fin end to gently exfoliate your skin. You can also use the Clinere® Earwax Removal
                    Kit to soften the wax, allowing for easier removal.</p>
